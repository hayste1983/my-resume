    <h2>About me...</h2>
    <p>I am currently working in my 6th year as a Senior QA for a large UK based print company.
    <p>Within this role I support manual and automated testing for a group of web developers and systems developers, working on 
    websites, APIs, databases and pretty anything else they want to throw at me.</p>
    <p>I'm looking to expand my skills into front end web development and then maybe branch out as a full stack developer, it's where the real
    money is after all!</p>

    <h2>Education</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>A-Level in Statistics - Rawlins Community College</li>
        <li>7 GCSEs including Maths & English grade C or above - Rawlins Communtiy College</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Everything else I know has been self taught or learnt on the job...</p>
    
    <h3>What relevant stuff I know:</h3>
    <p>This is how much I know about web development, this page is my second site, here's a link to my first:</p>
